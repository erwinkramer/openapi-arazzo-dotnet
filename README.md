# OpenAPI Arazzo Library for dotnet

This project provides a .NET implementation of the [OpenAPI Arazzo Specification](https://spec.openapis.org/arazzo/latest.html), allowing you to manage workflows for REST APIs with OpenAPI documents (v3.0+), following the official OpenAPI Arazzo 1.0.0 specification.

The library enables developers to programmatically apply parse, build, serialize, validate arazzo documents.

## Library

### Installing the library

You can install this library via the package explorer or using the following command.

```bash
dotnet add <pathToCsProj> package BinkyLabs.OpenApi.Arazzo
```

### Examples

#### Parsing an Arazzo document

The following example illustrates how you can load or parse an Arazzo document from JSON or YAML.

```csharp
var (arazzoDocument) = await ArazzoDocument.LoadFromUrlAsync("https://source/arazzo.json");
```

#### Serializing an Arazzo document

The following example illustrates how you can serialize an Arazzo document, built by the application or previously parsed, to JSON.

```csharp
var arazzoDocument = new ArazzoDocument
{
    Info = new ArazzoInfo
    {
        Title = "Test Arazzo",
        Version = "1.0.0"
    },
    Workflows = new List<ArazzoWorkflow>
    {
        new ArazzoWorkflow
        {
            //...
        }
    }
};

using var textWriter = new StringWriter();
var writer = new OpenApiJsonWriter(textWriter);
using var textWriter = new StringWriter();
var writer = new OpenApiJsonWriter(textWriter);
var jsonResult = textWriter.ToString();
// or use flush async if the underlying writer is a stream writer to a file or network stream
```
